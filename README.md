Hi, I’m Satko
- I’m interested in web development, web technologies, programming, science and tech in general.
- I have some experience with C programming, and I've done a couple of personal websites using boilerplate HTML, CSS, and some JavaScript.
- As of right now, I'm working as  full time SEO Analyst for a US company, as well as learning JavaScript. 
- In my free time, I love hiking, reading sci-fi or fantasy books, watching tv-shows and movies.
